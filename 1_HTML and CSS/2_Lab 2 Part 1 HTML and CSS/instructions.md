# Lab 2 — HTML and CSS

## Objectives

* practice editing HTML files
* practice editing/modifying CSS files
* share information about yourself with your community (this class)

## Instructions

Use information in the HTML module on Canvas as a reference for this lab.

You are provided with a more-or-less empty `index.html` file. It's a convention in web projects that the "home" page for a project is described in a file called `index`.

### HTML
Edit this html file (you can model it off the prior examples) to share a recipe for your favorite sandwich (or lunch).  Give the page the title "[YOUR NAME]'s recipe" (where [YOUR NAME] is just your first (preferred) name only).  The HTML must include the three sections as shown in the example:
* ingredients (your recipe must have at least 3 ingredients),
* tools and instructions for the creation,
* and an image of the food

### CSS
Add CSS styles to the `style.css`. Your stylesheet should be reasonable (i.e., the text should be legible) and include specifications for at least three different selectors. I encourage you to consult the MDN website as a CSS reference, and explore some style rules that we haven't talked about in class.

Note, this assignment will be public (shared with the entire class), so consider what you hand in with that in mind.
