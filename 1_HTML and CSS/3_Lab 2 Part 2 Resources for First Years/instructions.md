**_Preamble_**: One of the cool things about 'front end' development is that you can create resources for others.  Given what you know, you are in a position to compile information for others to use. 

## Goals

* practice using HTML/CSS
* share resources/information with others
* work in a team of your classmates to build community

## Task

**This is a team assignment. Work in groups of 3—4 students.**

**Task overview:**
Working with your team, three web pages including useful content (information, links, images) and an associated CSS style for consistency, to serve as a resource for others in the wider community.

For each webpage, create a new HTML file using the files sidebar in Replit. `index.html` will be your "home" page (i.e., the first page you will want users to see). The other two pages should be linked to from `index.html` using the HTML `<a>` tag. See the HTML module on Canvas for guidance on this.

Each webpage must include 300-700 words of content. Organize your results into some coherent organization (beginning, middle, end). You will be asked to explain your organization logic  for the three pages. Please select one of the following topic areas:

1) The college application process (you are all experts on this process, what did you learn, what helped you get through?) Possible organization: beginning your college search, applying, deciding on places to apply to, or another organizing principle. 

2) Advice on making the most of the summer of senior year. Possible organization: how to spend your time, get ready for college, move in and start off your college life.

3) Resources related to community hours/volunteering in high school.  Where did you volunteer or get community hours in high school?  Help high school students navigate the process of finding meaningful opportunities to engage in community hours. 

4) Create some resources on useful things to help making working on a computer easier. Note that is **not** an invitation to strut or show off esoteric computing knowledge, as that is not helpful in a computing class (or in most places). See the social rules at the recurse school for examples: [https://www.recurse.com/social-rules](https://www.recurse.com/social-rules). However, this is an opportunity to share some genuinely useful simple computer tricks/practices that might make our lives easier when working on a computer—things like setting an email filter in outlook to sort your mail by class, setting up multiple emails in google, etc. Only cover a few topics, but with LOTS of details and pictures to help others with any little simple 'tricks' that have made working on your computer easier/funner for your team.

5) Instructor approved resource pages.  Do you have a passion or lots of information to share? A story to tell? An organization you want to document?  Speak to me (TODAY) to get approval for any webpages on a topic not listed above.

**NOTE**. Your results will be made publicly available (publicly facing webpages linked from my faculty webpage). Please include all of your team members' first (preferred) names.
